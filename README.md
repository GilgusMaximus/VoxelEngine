# voxelEngine

The base purpose of this project is to dive into 3D programming, and understand the basic mechanics behind procedural generation.

The first goal is to be able to be able to generate (done), store(in theory done, because you only have to store the seed) and reload (in theory done, bc you only have to read the stored seed and seed the noise functions with it) infinite voxel terrain (see Cube World, Minecraft).
The second goal is to make it as open as possible, so that it is easy to plug in different scripts and shaders, to provide a foundation for future projects of all kinds.

The base code is based of the tutorial "learnopengl" (https://learnopengl.com) from Joey de Vries, to generate a window, 3D space, camera movement, lighting, etc.
